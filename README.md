# chessboardcoinkeyprisonerpuzzle
Python solution to this problem: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTJI_WuZSwE

The problem is very closely linked to Hamming codes in error correction. 
I think the code I wrote could be modified to detect and fix a single error in a 64-bit chunk of information.
You can enter the parities of the coins and the location of the key (e.g a1) in prisoner1 and it will tell you which coin to flip.
Entering the parties of the coin in prisoner2 will tell you where the key is. 
The squares are labelled like in an excel spreadsheet, a to h from left to right, 1 to 8 from top to bottom. 
I have also uploaded a video demonstrating how it works.
I hope you find it interesting!
